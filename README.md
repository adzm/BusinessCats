# Serious Business Cats
Embed images inline... for Serious Business!
For Skype for Business and Lync for Anachronisms.

## Download and Install

[Download the zip file here](https://github.com/adzm/BusinessCats/releases/download/1.0.2/BusinessCats-1.0.2.zip) and extract the contents to a folder to run. As cats are distrustful and lazy creatures, and also portable ones, there is no installer.

## Features

- Embed images directly inline within your conversations!
	- Optimized palette and automatic resizing to fit Lync / Skype for Business client limitations.
	- Snip sections from the current display / screenshot.
	- Snips are archived automatically.
	- Trying to copy the image in the Lync / Skype4b client crashes the client. We have decided that this is a feature.
- Blp! your friends and enemies!
	- It's like poking someone, except even more annoying.
	- The window or tab will flash as if a message was received, and may even display a preview of a previous message, but no new message will appear on the recipient's conversation.
- WhisperCats! Have a conversation on the side that cannot be eavesdropped.
	- Diffie-Hellman key exchange with AES encryption.
	- An active MITM can defeat this, but come on, this is Serious Business Cats, we do it because we can!
- Dark theme! Light theme! WPF Metro MahApps funky hipster downtown alley cat moxie homebrew tuxedo longfluff.
	- Get eaten by sharks. I wouldn't risk it. But you'll probably try it. The only limitation is yourself.
- Like all good software, this started as an experiment or maybe a joke or a dice-rolling robot and ended up becoming actually useful.

## Disclaimer

This is for Serious Business, not cats or image macros, nor Business Cat nor even Krahs Wobniar. Parboil rabbit or maybe bone-in chicken and grind it. Garnish with catnip and heavy gravy.

## Is it breakfast time?

No! It is Serious Business Cats time!
